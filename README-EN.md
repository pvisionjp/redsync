# Difficulty in tracking the project

For a project manager, it is imperative to share the project schedule with the project members and track their progress in a timely manner. But what about the project members? Activities such as checking the schedule and reporting the progress are often regarded as administrative hassles and given less priority. It leads to a delay in perceiving bad signs of the project and exposes the project to critical risks.

# Incorporate project tracking into day-to-day project work

RedSync incorporates the project tracking capability into Trello’s ability to support daily project work. By integrating Redmine with Trello, Trello becomes a single tool for project members to perform project work and project tracking.

![To-Be Solution](https://pvision.jp/apps/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/redsync-system-to-be.png)

Trello is a great tool to support daily project work. A project manager defines a work on a Card, and the project members then populate it with additional work information like work instructions and work results.

RedSync creates Cards from Redmine Issues; hence, the daily work defined in Cards aligns with the project WBS defined in Issues. Then RedSync synchronizes the information between the Cards and the Issues. Thus, a Card and an Issue represent each other.

As a result,

- A project manager can organize the work (Cards) according to WBS (Issues).
- Project members can check the schedule and priority of their assigned work on the Card and report the work’s progress as part of day-to-day project work.
- A project manager can monitor the work progress and grasp the overall project status using the reporting tools of Redmine, like the Gantt chart.
